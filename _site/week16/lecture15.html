## This course

<img src="images/week_thelast.png" width="95%">

notes:
Look at all the stuff we covered!

Today we'll cover our last topics -- networks and word clouds

We'll really focus on word clouds in the coding and if we have time we'll get into networks, but 
we'll focus on networks in the lecture portion


---

## Extra credit: Network Viz

Make sure you see the notes on TurnItIn in previous lectures!

notes:
keep in mind that we have an extra credit assignment, worth 1 homework grade, that is in this week's page

also recall that the maximum you can get on the homework is 100% of that category, so if you have a perfect HW score, you can't do better than that!

---

## Notes on Final, Part 3

Due dates:
 1. First draft of Part 3 -- due December 2, will get feedback course participants
 1. Post your link in the Canvas forum to get feedback from classmates -- December 3
 1. Provide feedback for 3 randomly *assigned* classmates -- due December 9
 1. Final chance to resubmit your Part 3 -- December 14
 
**Please be aware these are hard deadlines -- no extensions available**
 
notes:
go to pages!!

because we have to get grades in by a certain time, these due dates are hard ones -- no extensions.

your "first" part 3 submission CAN be a work in progress -- you can outline what you want to do, but the more you have done, the better we can give you feedback and the more there is for your other feedback-giving classmates to work with

# Topic 2: Networked & Hierarchical Data

## Networked and Hierarchical Data

 1. Node-link diagrams
 1. Matrix views

<img src="images/compareMatrixNT.png" width="800"/>

From: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258716465_Visualizing_Weighted_Networks_A_Performance_Comparison_of_Adjacency_Matrices_versus_Node-link_Diagrams">this article</a>

notes:
There are two primary types of visualization for data that has inherent linkages.

This figure here is actually showing the same networked dataset.

We'll talk about these two primary ways of displaying networks in order.

---

## Node-link Diagrams

 1. Nodes
   * might have 0-to-many edges linked to them
 1. Edges (sometimes called "links")
   * associated specifically with 2 nodes
   * can have a direction
   * can have a weight

<img src="images/coldWarLong.jpg" width="800"/>

notes:

First: node-link diagrams.

This is a node-link diagram of some selected military alliances during the Cold War.

Here, the nodes are the named countries and the links are the lines between them.

**read list**

---

## Node-link Diagrams

 1. Nodes
   * might have 0-to-many edges linked to them
 1. Edges (sometimes called "links")
   * associated specifically with 2 nodes
   * can have a direction
   * can have a weight

<img src="images/geneticNetwork.png" width="800"/>

notes:
One common use-case for these is genetics. Scientists need visualizations to understand how one gene affects another, either directly OR **indirectly**.

here is shown an example of how the BRCA genes associated with some forms of breast cancer are linked to various other genes.

---

## Node-link Diagrams

 1. Trees
 1. Force-Directed Graphs (displayed below)
 
<img src="images/geneticNetwork.png" width="800"/>


notes:


There are a few ways to draw node-link diagrams.

These are the primary ways that you would draw a linked node diagram -- trees and force-directed graphs.

This gene map is an example of a "force directed graph" type.

---

## Node-link Diagrams

 1. Trees
 1. Force-Directed Graphs (displayed below)

<img src="images/circlesTree.png" width="400"/>

notes:

Here is an example of another force-directed graph, but in general, both trees and force-directed graphs can have several attributes.

You might have different sizes of symbols, different shapes, or different link or symbol colors to encode other information.

---

## Node-link Diagrams

 1. Trees
 1. Force-Directed Graphs (displayed below)

<img src="images/hairball.png" width="600"/>

From: <a href="https://github.com/jcatw/snap-facebook">this GitHub</a>

notes: in the python lecture we'll be working with a subset of this facebook dataset - showing linkages between individuals as their facebook friendships

this is a node-link, force-directed graph diagram of this full facebook dataset showing groups of connected individuals, and how the groups are connected to eachother.


---

## Node-link Diagrams: Force-Directed Graphs

 * Nodes push away from each other as if their edges are springs.
 * Nodes push away from each other by local repulsion force.
 * Forces can be weighted.

<img src="images/forceDirectedGraph.gif" width="450"/>

notes:
These use simulated forces to push apart what might otherwise look like a mad hairball.

Edge springyness can be weighted by edge weight, node repulsion can be weighted by node weight. (We'll play with this)

You could place the points in any arbitrary place and let them evolve. You could start with a scatter plot representing numerical values, but the nodes will just move. You could also put all the points at the same starting place.

Note that this means these plots are in a sense "non-deterministic" in that you can get slightly different plots every time. 

---

## Node-link Diagrams: Force-Directed Graphs

 * Path Distance
 * Joint or Disjoint
 * Discrete, not Continuous

<img src="images/disjoint.png" width="450"/>

notes:
These are useful for identifying clusters, finding all possible paths, finding the shortest path, finding all adjacent nodes, finding bridges between unconnected nodes, etc.

---

## Node-link Diagrams: Force-Directed Graphs

 1. Drawbacks:
   * Non-deterministic (different every time)
   * Link Density can be an issue when over 3-4 links per node

<img src="images/SocialNetworkAnalysis.png" width="550"/>

notes:
this is a social network graph that looks fine at high resolution, but on this screen is more or less unreadable.

---

## Node-link Diagrams: Tree Diagrams

 * Topological
 * Ordered
   * Left-to-Right
   * Inside-Out
   * Top-to-bottom
 * Always one incoming edge (low density)
 * Discrete, not Continuous

<img src="images/trees.png" width="800"/>

notes:
trees have a topology or hierarchy. These are especially good for a *deep* hierarchy.

The physical space between nodes isn't meaningful like it would be in a scatter plot. Rather the number of "hops" along edges is important.

The left hand plot has a top-down ordering, while the right-hand plot is ordered radially such that the most connected object is at the center.


---

## Matrix Views

 1. Adjacency Matrix
   * List all values along X AND Y axes

<img src="images/coldWarLong.jpg" width="400"/></td>
<img src="images/coldWarMatrix.png" width="400"/></td>

notes:

Matrix views are the other main way to visualize network data in contrast to node-link diagrams.

Matrix views remove occlusion and hairball issues completely. They are preferred for extremely dense data.

However they do not show topology, and they might be less intuitive to identify clustering.

---

## Matrix Views

 1. Adjacency Matrix
   * List all values along X AND Y axes
   * Can cut in half along diagonal if non-directional

<img src="images/foldedAdjacencyMatrix.jpg" width="450"/>

notes:
This is sometimes called a "Folded" adjacency matrix

---

## Matrix Views

 1. Adjacency Matrix
   * List all values along X AND Y axes
   * Can cut in half along diagonal if non-directional
   * Color cells by edge weight

<img src="images/brains.png" width="400"/>

notes:
Matrix views remove occlusion and hairball issues completely. They are preferred for extremely dense data.

However they do not show topology, and they might be less intuitive to identify clustering.

As you can see by the square plots here - these are supposed to show the networked structure of some brain data - can you easily pick out what variables are linked? (I can't!)

---

## Matrix Views

<img src="images/pokemonTypeChart.png" width="500"/>

notes:
Pokemon type-effectiveness chart yay!

So, AJ (the other instructor) put this in and I think I'd be remiss if I didn't show it, but I literally have no idea what is going on here - does anybody here play pokeman and can explain it to the class?

Notice this is directional - Attackers and Defenders don't have same effect on different types.

---

## Special networks: Hierarchical Data

 1. Trees
 1. Containment
   1. Treemaps

<img src="images/d3treemap.png" width="500"/>

notes:

Sometimes in addition to being a network dataset, there is a natural hierarcy to the data.  

A great way to show this data is with trees.  

Another way to look at this kind of networked data - treemaps

containment better at shallow, broad trees than node-link tree diagrams

good for identifying topological outliers

This visualization is file size of the D3 visualization library.

---

## Special networks: Hierarchical Data

 1. Trees
 1. Containment
   1. Treemaps
   1. Nested Circles

<img src="images/circlePacking.png" width="400"/>

notes:

another way is to use nested structures like circles.

This is also known as circle-packing.

---

## Compound Networks

 1. Network and Tree together

<img src="images/grouseFlocks.gif" width="350"/>
<img src="images/compoundNetwork.png" width="450"/>

notes:
Now we're combining a hierarchical nested circle containment WITH linked nodes from our cold war alliances.

There are lots of ways to combine types of network visualizations like this.

## Today's Python: Networks & Word clouds

<img src="https://getthematic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Harris-Word-Cloud-e1522406279125.png" width="600px">

notes:
We'll be focusing a lot on ways of representing text occurances in Python with histograms and wordclouds and then if we have time we'll circle back to networks
