# Resources

## Data and Python Libs

 1. Download and unzip [this set of files here (galaxyFiles.zip, 77M)](galaxyFiles.zip)
 2. Make note of where this unzips -- this is where `solverlibs.py` gets unpacked.

 3. We'll also be using the <a href="http://yt-project.org/data/IsolatedGalaxy.tar.gz" download>Isolated Galaxy dataset (292 Mb)</a> dataset for sci viz today
 4. We'll also also be using <a href="https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week05/data/single_dicom.h5" download>this brain scan data (72Mb)</a>
