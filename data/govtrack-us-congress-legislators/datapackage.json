{"name":"govtrack_us-congress-legislators","title":"US Congress Legislators","description":"Legislators Data Dictionary\n---------------------------\n\nThe following fields are available in `legislators-current.csv` and `legislators-historical.csv`:\n\n* bioguide_id: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator in http://bioguide.congress.gov. Note that at one time some legislators (women who had changed their name when they got married) had two entries on the bioguide website. Only one bioguide ID is included here. **This is the best field to use as a primary key.**\n* thomas_id: The numeric ID for this legislator on http://thomas.gov and http://beta.congress.gov. The ID is stored as a string with leading zeros preserved.\n* lis_id: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator found in Senate roll call votes (http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).\n* fec_id: A *list* of IDs for this legislator in Federal Election Commission data.\n* govtrack_id: The numeric ID for this legislator on GovTrack.us (stored as an integer).\n* opensecrets_id: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator on OpenSecrets.org.\n* votesmart_id: The numeric ID for this legislator on VoteSmart.org (stored as an integer).\n* icpsr_id: The numeric ID for this legislator in Keith Poole's VoteView.com website, originally based on an ID system by the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (stored as an integer).\n* cspan_id: The numeric ID for this legislator on C-SPAN's video website, e.g. http://www.c-spanvideo.org/person/1745 (stored as an integer).\n* wikipedia_id: The Wikipedia page name for the person (spaces are given as spaces, not underscores).\n* ballotpedia_id: The ballotpedia.org page name for the person (spaces are given as spaces, not underscores).\n* maplight_id : The numeric ID for this legislator on maplight.org (stored as an integer).\n* house_history_id: The numeric ID for this legislator on http://history.house.gov/People/Search/. The ID is present only for members who have served in the U.S. House.\n* bioguide_previous_id: When bioguide.congress.gov mistakenly listed a legislator under multiple IDs, this field is a *list* of alternative IDs. (This often ocurred for women who changed their name.) The IDs in this list probably were removed from bioguide.congress.gov but might still be in use in the wild.\n\n* first_name: The legislator's first name. Sometimes a first initial and period (e.g. in W. Todd Akin), in which case it is suggested to not use the first name for display purposes.\n* middle_name: The legislator's middle name or middle initial (with period).\n* last_name: The legislator's last name. Many last names include non-ASCII characters. When building search systems, it is advised to index both the raw value as well as a value with extended characters replaced with their ASCII equivalents (in Python that's: u\"\".join(c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', lastname) if not unicodedata.combining(c))).\n* suffix_name: A suffix on the legislator's name, such as \"Jr.\" or \"III\".\n* nickname_name: The legislator's nick name when used as a common alternative to his first name.\n* official_full_name: The full name of the legislator according to the House or Senate (usually first, middle initial, nickname, last, and suffix). Present for those serving on 2012-10-30 and later.\n* other_names, when present, lists other names the legislator has gone by officially. This is helpful in cases where a legislator's legal name has changed. These listings will only include the name attributes which differ from the current name, and a start or end date where applicable. Where multiple names exist, other names are listed chronologically by end date. \n\n* birthday_bio: The legislator's birthday, in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n* gender_bio: The legislator's gender, either \"M\" or \"F\". (In historical data, we've worked backwards from [history.house.gov's Women in Congress feature](http://history.house.gov/People/Search?filter=6).)\n* religion_bio: The legislator's religion.\n\nThe following fields are available in `legislators-current-terms.csv` and `legislators-historical-terms.csv` (one entry for each election):\n\n* type: The type of the term. Either \"sen\" for senators or \"rep\" for representatives and delegates to the House.\n* start: The date legislative service began: the date the legislator was sworn in, if known, or else the beginning of the legislator's term. Since 1935 regularly elected terms begin on January 3 at noon on odd-numbered years, but when Congress does not first meet on January 3, term start dates might reflect that swearing-in occurred on a later date. (Prior to 1935, terms began on March 4 of odd-numbered years, see [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/pull/305).) Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.\n* end: The date the term ended (because the Congress ended or the legislator died or resigned, etc.). End dates follow the Constitutional end of a term. Since 1935, terms begin and end on January 3 at noon in odd-numbered years, and thus a term end date may also be a term start date. Prior to 1935, terms began on March 4 and ended either on March 3 or March 4. The end date is the last date on which the legislator served this term. Unlike the start date, whether Congress was in session or not does not affect the value of this field.\n* state: The two-letter, uppercase USPS abbreviation for the state that the legislator is serving from. See below.\n* district: For representatives, the district number they are serving from. At-large districts are district 0. In historical data, unknown district numbers are recorded as -1.\n* class: For senators, their election class (1, 2, or 3). Note that this is unrelated to seniority.\n* state_rank: For senators, whether they are the \"junior\" or \"senior\" senator (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the senator's rank at the time the term ended).\n* party: The political party of the legislator. If the legislator changed parties, this is the most recent party held during the term and `party_affiliations` will be set. Values are typically \"Democrat\", \"Independent\", or \"Republican\". The value typically matches the political party of the legislator on the ballot in his or her last election, although for state affiliate parties such as \"Democratic Farmer Labor\" we will use the national party name (\"Democrat\") instead to keep the values of this field normalized.\n* caucus: For independents, the party that the legislator caucuses with, using the same values as the `party` field. Omitted if the legislator caucuses with the party indicated in the party field. When in doubt about the difference between the `party` and `caucus` fields, the `party` field is what displays after the legislator's name (i.e. \"(D)\") but the `caucus` field is what normally determines committee seniority. This field was added starting with terms for the 113th Congress.\n* party_affiliations: This field is present if the legislator changed party or caucus affiliation during the term. The value is a list of time periods, with `start` and `end` dates, each of which has a `party` field and a `caucus` field if applicable, with the same meanings as the main `party` and `caucus` fields. The time periods cover the entire term, so the first `start` will match the term `start`, the last `end` will match the term `end`, and the last `party` (and `caucus` if present) will match the term `party` (and `caucus`).\n* url: The official website URL of the legislator (only valid if the term is current).\n* address: The mailing address of the legislator's Washington, D.C. office (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known address).\n* phone: The phone number of the legislator's Washington, D.C. office (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known number).\n* fax: The fax number of the legislator's Washington, D.C. office (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known number).\n* contact_form: The website URL of the contact page on the legislator's official website (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known URL).\n* office: Similar to the address field, this is just the room and building number, suitable for display (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known office).\n* rss_url The URL to the official website's RSS feed (only valid if the term is current, otherwise the last known URL).\n\n**Leadership roles**:\n\n```yaml\nleadership_roles:\n  - title: Minority Leader\n    chamber: senate\n    start: '2007-01-04'\n    end: '2009-01-06'\n```\n\nFor members with top formal positions of leadership in each party in each chamber, a `leadership_roles` field will include an array of start/end dates and titles documenting when they held this role.\n\nLeadership terms are not identical to legislative terms, and so start and end dates will be different than legislative term dates. However, leaders do need to be re-elected each legislative term, so their leadership terms should all be subsets of their legislative terms.\n\nExcept where noted, fields are omitted when their value is empty or unknown. Any field may be unknown.\n\nNotes:\nIn most cases, a legislator has a single term on any given date. In some cases a legislator resigned from one chamber and was sworn in in the other chamber on the same day.\nTerms for senators list each six-year term, so the terms span three Congresses. For representatives and delegates, each two-year term is listed, each corresponding to a single Congress. But Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner serves four-year terms, and so the Resident Commissioner will have a single term covering two Congresses (this has not been updated in historical data).\n\nHistorically, some states sending at-large representatives actually sent multiple at-large representatives. Thus, state and district may not be a unique key.\n\nData on Official Social Media Accounts\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis dataset is designed to include accounts that are paid for with public funds and which represent official communications of their office. We rely on reasonable verification from the legislative office about the status of their accounts.\n\nOffices are supposed to maintain strict separation of official funds and campaign funds, and official funds are not supposed to be used to further things like re-election efforts.\n\nIn practice, a campaign account may often look similar to an official account in terms of content, especially when expressing views on issues and legislations. However, there will be differences in what's appropriate for each account, and they will likely be maintained by different staff employed by different organizations.\n\nThe social media file `legislators-social-media.yaml` stores current social media account information.\n\nEach record has two sections: `id` and `social`. The `id` section identifies the legislator using bioguide, thomas, and govtrack IDs (where available). The `social` section has social media account identifiers:\n\n* twitter: The current official Twitter handle of the legislator.\n* youtube: The current official YouTube username of the legislator.\n* youtube_id: The current official YouTube channel ID of the legislator.\n* instagram: The current official Instagram handle of the legislator.\n* instagram_id: The numeric ID of the current official Instagram handle of the legislator.\n* facebook: The username of the current official Facebook presence of the legislator.\n* facebook_id: The numeric ID of the current official Facebook presence of the legislator.\n\nSeveral legislators do not have an assigned YouTube username.  In these cases, only the youtube_id field is populated.\n\nAll values can be turned into URLs by preceding them with the domain name of the service in question (and in the case of YouTube channels, the path `/channel`):\n\n* `https://twitter.com/[twitter]`\n* `https://youtube.com/user/[youtube]`\n* `https://youtube.com/channel/[youtube_id]`\n* `https://instagram/[instagram]`\n* `https://facebook.com/[facebook or facebook_id]`\n\nLegislators are only present when they have one or more social media accounts known. Fields are omitted when the account is unknown.\n* `--resolveig` Uses Instagram user IDs to look up any usernames, and updates the YAML accordingly.\n\nsource: https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators","homepage":"https://data.world/govtrack/us-congress-legislators","license":"Public Domain","resources":[{"name":"legislators_current","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"ballotpedia_id","title":"ballotpedia_id","description":"The ballotpedia.org page name for the person (spaces are given as spaces, not underscores).","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"ballotpedia_id"},{"name":"bioguide_id","title":"bioguide_id","description":"The alphanumeric ID for this legislator in http://bioguide.congress.gov.
