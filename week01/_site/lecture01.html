<p>notes:
So, all of this isn’t news to anybody probably but a few things to be aware of</p>
<ul>
  <li>masks are no longer required by the university, but recommended by the CDC, which we acknowledge is confusing</li>
  <li>so, we’ll just strongly recommend that folks wear masks, long covid is real and it is scary</li>
  <li>at the same time, please don’t make assumptions about why a person does or does not wear a mask – we don’t know what is going on in any given person’s life in detail!</li>

<h2 id="class-size-notes">Class Size Notes</h2>

<p>125+ across two sections!</p>

<p><strong>Strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>a total of 12 hours of office hours (Prof+TA’s) every week</li>
  <li>utilize Slack for general question/answer (can be across sections!)</li>
  <li>group options for several homeworks/final project</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
so, we have 125 students in this class across two sections, this is a large class!</p>

<p>we will go over some of these strategies in detail, but I wanted to give you an overview of somethings that we are doing to cover everybody AND some things you can do to help us and your fellow classmates out</p>

<p>the first thing is we have an extra 12 hours of help time outside of class to answer questions in the form of office hours (more details next slide)</p>

<p>also, we will have a Slack channel (more on that in a moment) where you can get more quick responses from the instructional team if you post in the #general channel</p>

<p>finally, we have several assignments that can be turned in as a group to allow for collaboration between folks in the class, AND across class sections – we’ll talk about those assignments as we come to them</p>

  <li>How would you quantify your experience in visualization?</li>
  <li>How many hours do you spend online in classes each week?</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
We’re going to use these pieces of data to explore how we might approach
visualization.  Each of these items is a different <em>type</em> of data –
qualitative, quantitative, elements drawn from sets, and sets of numerical
data.</p>

<p>Trying to visualize each one will give us a basic idea of how we might think
about these types of data, and how we approach visualizing them.</p>

<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1 (Today) - Introduction</li>
  <li>Week 2 - Data Storage and Operations</li>
  <li>Week 3 - Types of Viz and Choosing Colors</li>
  <li>Week 4 - Beginning interactivity</li>
  <li>Week 5 - Continuing interactivity with bqplot (<strong>I am out of town this week!</strong>)</li>
  <li>Week 6 - More with dashboards &amp; Map Viz</li>
  <li>Week 7 - Maps, maps and more maps</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
This is a rough syllabus!  These are many of the topics we will cover, but
based on how the course proceeds and how folks respond, we may shorten or
lengthen different topics.</p>

<p>The organization here is designed to start out slow, dealing with how to
program python for visualization, understanding how data is laid out, which
operations we can apply to that data, and then moving on to representing data
in different ways.</p>

<p>We might start getting into javascript earlier, depending on how we are doing.</p>

<p><strong>Please be aware!</strong> I will be at a conference during week #5, but we will have recordings of the material from last semester for you all to look at and I will be available on Slack that week as well</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="syllabus-cont">Syllabus, cont</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Week 8 - Starboard and Intro to Javascript</li>
  <li>Week 9 - Viz Audience; More Starboard/Observable, Javascript &amp; Vega-lite</li>
  <li>Week 10 - Intro to Jekyll</li>
  <li>Week 11 - More with Jekyll+Altair, Publishing Viz</li>
  <li>Week 12/13 - A few more Jekyll+Altair+vega-lite things</li>
  <li>Week 14 - Fall break!</li>
  <li>Week 13/15 - Scientific Viz &amp; AVL Guest lecture</li>
  <li>Week 15/16 - Network Visualization &amp; Word clouds</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
Toward the end of class we are going to have a slightly more free-form set of
discussion points.  Your final projects will be somewhat open-ended, requiring
more group work and collaboration than the preceding assignments.</p>

<p>Here the weeks get a little off between the in-person and online classes because of the election day holiday and this is also reflected in the Canvas page.  We’ll be working on final project stuff then, so it shouldn’t be an issue too much.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="syllabus-in-summary">Syllabus: In summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1-5: Basics of visualization (Python)</li>
  <li>Weeks 6-10: Interactivity and Viz Types (Python and Javascript)</li>
  <li>Weeks 11-16: Platforms and dimensionality (Python, Javascript, Web-dev methods)</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
basically, we’ll start with the basics - I’m assuming you are coming in with Python experience</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assumptions-about-python-experience">Assumptions about Python experience</h2>

<p>IS430 with a programming project</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>IS205 + one more Python-based programming class</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Equivalent informal Python background</p>

<p>notes:
so what do I mean by “python experience”?  Here are some rough guidelines for courses</p>

<p>Since there are no enforced pre-reqs, you can also get Python experience in industry as well</p>

<p>Basically, I’m expecting that you understand all the logical operations like if-then, for loops, are comfortable using external libraries, and reading/writing and manipulating data to some extent – check out the prep notebooks for the level that is expected</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assumptions-about-python-experience-1">Assumptions about Python experience</h2>

<p>IS430 with a programming project</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>IS205 + one more Python-based programming class</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Equivalent informal Python background</p>

<p>Extra coding help: https://ischool.illinois.edu/student-life/academic-support-center (see Tutoring by Subject and Skill)</p>

<p>notes:
that being said, I have had students that were just starting off in their programming journeys be successful in this class, but just be aware its going to require extra time commitement</p>

<p>In addition to all of the hours of office hours, you should check out the academic support center, in particular the Tutoring by Subject and Skill where you can find Python tutors</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="class-mission">Class Mission</h1>

<p>While you are already a <em>consumer</em> of visualizations, your
perspective should change to that of a <em>producer</em> of visualizations.
You should be comfortable reading AND writing imagery.</p>

<p>notes:
We will be discussing this as the semester goes on, but the principal outcome I
want you to take away from this class is understanding how to transform data
into its visual representation, and to take that understanding with you as you
observe visualizations presented to you.</p>

<p>By developing visualizations, you will grow to understand the choices that
influence those visualizations, and you will bring that with you while
consuming information visually.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-things-i-want-you-to-take-away">The Things I Want You To Take Away</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You should know the basics of how to manipulate data – aggregations,
filterings, and other operations.</li>
  <li>I want you to know <em>some</em> of the packages that are out there to visualize
data.  These will mostly be Python-based, with a couple in Javascript.</li>
  <li>You won’t learn how to use dashboarding software (e.g. Tableau) in detail. Instead, we
will focus on the different operations that go into dashboarding software.</li>
  <li>By the end of the course, you will have had the opportunity to look at and
build visualizations in several different domains and understand how to
interpret, critique and improve them.</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
This course <em>will</em> teach you some things about how to code, how to build
visualizations, but we’re going to focus much more on learning about how to
construct visualizations and why we make the choices that we do.  If we choose
one way to present data, does that convey information more readily?  Or does it
get in the way of the underlying meaning?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="overview---themes-and-goals">Overview - Themes and Goals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What are the components of an effective visualization of quantitative data?</li>
  <li>What tools and ecosystems are available for visualizing data?</li>
  <li>What systems can be put in place to generate visualizations rapidly and with high-fidelity representation?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="structure-of-class">Structure of Class</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Topic introduction and lecture (~60-90 minutes)</li>
  <li>Hands-on, in class coding</li>
  <li>Wrap-up</li>
</ul>

<p>(Today will be a little lecture heavy)</p>

<p>notes:
This structure will likely be deviated from during the course, but in general
we will start with lecture, take a break, then continue with collaborative or
hands-on exercises using group coding.</p>

<p>During the group coding, I might lead the class in some visualization in
Python, Javascript, or something else.  During this section, I expect that
students will <em>follow along</em> with what is going on – typing in the specific
commands, and maybe even trying different things as we go.  It is not meant to
simply be a “performance” of coding, but instead an opportunity to learn.</p>

<p>YOU HAVE THE NOTES BEFORE CLASS.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>40% Standard assignments in prose or code form</li>
  <li>30% Weekly visualization reports</li>
  <li>30% Final project <a href="https://jnaiman.github.io/online_cv_public/">teaser trailer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
Your weekly assignments will take different forms.  The first assignment will
be mostly prose and hand-writing with some installations, but subsequent assignments will be
either notebook (coding) based or prose-based as well.</p>

<p>The final project will be described later in class, but will take the form of a
group project that touches on coding as well as visual design.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="weekly-visualization-reports">Weekly Visualization Reports</h2>

<p>Every week, you are to turn in a visualization you have found in the media
(newspapers, magazines, online journalism) and a brief summary of something you like/don’t like,
think is interesting, etc.</p>

<p><em>These are meant to be easy points:</em> No more than 2-3 sentences are needed in your description.</p>

<p>Each week, one of you will at random be asked to describe the visualization you picked to the class.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assignments-not-necessarily-weekly">Assignments (not necessarily weekly)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly-ish, assigned in class, collected following class</li>
  <li>Prose assignments: deconstruction or analysis of a visualization or a dataset.</li>
  <li>Coding assignments: Jupyter/JSMD/etc notebooks following step by step
through collection and processing of data and the visualization of that
data</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="optional-reading-assignments"><em>Optional</em> reading assignments</h2>

<p>See the course syllabus:</p>

<p>https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/is445_bcubcg_fall2022/syllabus.html</p>

<p>notes:
These are TOTally optional - more on that in a minute.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Plagiarism is about copying ideas.</li>
  <li>Cite all code you utilize from elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
When programming, I expect that you will do things like search on the internet
to find help with a given problem.  This is fine.</p>

<p>But, you <em>must</em> cite where any code snippets came from.  And you <em>must</em> note if
you are working with other people in the group!</p>

<p>Using snippets of code is fine – but you may not copy large-scale amounts of
code from other work (for example, other visualizations) and pass it off as
your own.  Always cite, and be reasonable in what you utilize.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="plagiarism-1">Plagiarism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Plagiarism is about copying ideas.</li>
  <li>Cite all code you utilize from elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>TurnItIn is meant to help you with this process (for specific file types).</p>

<p>notes:
turnitin is turned on for all assignments, but you can see your report right after you submit IF ITS THE RIGHT FILE TYPE</p>

<p>Depending on file type reports may/may not be supported (for example, its not supported for notebook files)</p>

<p>Click on “Submission Details” to see your report, but again, this will only work for specific kinds of files.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="our-tools">Our tools</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python, with some Javascript along the way</li>
  <li>Jupyter and Jupyter notebooks</li>
  <li>The occasional usage of a shell such as bash</li>
  <li>Git/GitHub toward the end of class</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
You will be expected to write code in Python, and to learn the very basics of
Javascript.  Your projects may be turned in via git.  We will also utilize
Slack for class communication.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="viz-systems-we-will-cover">Viz Systems We Will Cover</h2>

<p>In approximate order:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bqplot.readthedocs.io">bqplot</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite">vega-lite</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html">Altair</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There’ll be a few more along the way.</p>

<p>notes:
This class is not meant to teach you a given tool, but instead a way of
thinking about using visualization tools.  These tools are chosen because of
what they represent, not because they are the only paths to success.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="tools-we-will-use">Tools We Will Use</h2>

<ul>

<p>notes:
These tools represent many different ways to explore and visualize data.  We’ll
use a mix of local installations &amp; web-services.</p>

We’re going to start out at a very high-level, discussing why we choose to

might do it.</p>

<p>“Computer-based <em>visualization</em> systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visualization Analysis &amp; Design, Tamara Munzner</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
I really like this definition because it gives us a sense of purpose - i.e. that our visualization must help a human with a task that has to do with data.</p>

<p>notes:
Visual information is communicated through our eyes, where it is processed.  At
the most basic level, we can see a range of about 210 degrees horizontally with
one or both eyes.  The region that is covered by both (“binocular”) is about
114 degrees in extent.</p>

<p>You can only cram so much information into the human eye.</p>

<p>notes:
When we think about visual communication of information, we <em>must</em> think about
how human physiology interacts with that communication.</p>

<p>Also, fair warning: I’m not a medical doctor.</p>

<p>This diagram shows the visual acuity of a “standard” human eye, as a function
of angular distance from the fovea.  We have to think about this in
<em>conjunction</em> with our field of view.</p>

compare this to how long it would take to spot differences in 2 songs - you’d have to listen to both songs (probably more than once) and compare after!  This would be sequential rather than parallel data transfer!</p>

<p>notes:
You might immediately notice a few things about this image, but one item that
we will talk about as class goes on is that often visualizations can have a
consistent style.  FRED in particular has a “branding” that is quite obvious,
even without the logo.</p>

  <li>Organization of that data</li>

collection, organization and representation of data.</p>

<p>We tell lies to visualize, but we <em>must</em> be honest. (Stuart Levy, AVL)</p>

<p><img src="images/proportionalInk.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>notes:
So let’s first talk about how misleading visualizations can be. This 3D pie chart violates the “principle of proportional ink” which states that the number of pixels that represent a value should be proportional to the value. With the raised edge on the pie chart, the blue wedge gets way more ink than it deserves and you get a disproportionate sense of value.</p>

<p>notes:
you can have a lot of absurd fun with data - but when data is presented in a visualization, people often believe the authority of it even if it’s outlandish.</p>

<p>This guy has some good ideas of where to find sample datasets for upcoming homework assignments too!</p>

<p>notes:
Now here’s an example that’s more brazen. I’ll give you a minute to analyze this and tell me what’s wrong with this graph.</p>

<p>Some people will claim the Y-axis should always start from the bottom - at zero - to avoid confusion.</p>

<hr />

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/keelingCurve.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<p>notes:
however, the Keeling Curve is an interesting counter-argument. This is the famous graph that was the original evidence for global warming, showing the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide was growing.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why it’s generally accepted to show the y-axis like this, without it starting at the zero axis?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sensors read the current “fill” of the battery
    <ul>
      <li>Analog / digital conversion</li>
      <li>Normalized with respect to expected “full”</li>

  </li>
  <li>This is then scaled to a percentage</li>

This is a screenshot from the movie “Lilo and Stitch” where the little girl Lilo is graphing how much evil is in the alien Stitch. It borrows from a familiar visual - the thermometer. But how could this visualization be misinterpreted? How is it different from a thermometer?</p>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_nobg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

<p>notes:
The angle can be misleading. So can the relative width of the head vs the feet. The surface area is not consistent from top to bottom. Also there are empty areas in the mouth and eyes!</p>

<p>notes:
If we rotate the image so that the red liquid is level, do we get a different impression for how much bad is in Stitch?</p>

<p>Mark Newman of the University of Michigan has created visualizations of the
election maps from several of the most recent elections.  For more information
and context, see his page http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/ .</p>

<p>notes:
These are great, but some criticisms might be that the color red is more apparent to the human eye than the color blue. And in the population-to-area adjusted maps, it’s difficult to read for people used to geographic accuracy.</p>

<p>Map1 - this is just a geographical map of red and blue</p>

<p>Map2 - cartogram weighted by population (note, NOT by electoral college population)</p>

<p>Map3 - election results by county</p>

<p>Map4 - percentage of votes by county</p>

<p>Map5 - percentage of votes by county, weighted by population</p>
