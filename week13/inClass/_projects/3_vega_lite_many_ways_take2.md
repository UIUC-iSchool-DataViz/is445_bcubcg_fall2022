# General ways to include vega-lite plots

Order of operations:

1. generate a JSON specification (from somewhere -- vega-editor, 
Altair, etc)
1. save the JSON specification into `assets/json`
1. include the "vega-lite tag" with the following example code:

```
<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/fromvegaeditor.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>
```

## 1. Including vega-lite plots directly from the editor

If we are copying from the [vega-editor](https://vega.github.io/editor) we want to make sure we have the full data link.  We can find that by Googling for "vega datasets github" which takes us [right here](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets/tree/next/data) and we can search for our dataset.

Make sure it is the "raw" form of the data!

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/interactivescatter_fulllink.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>


## 2. How to use vega-lite specifications from other sources (i.e. Starboard)

Starting with a static histogram plot with the Mobility dataset from a [Starboard Notebook from Week 10](https://starboard.gg/nb/nrSZM7g).

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/mobility_hist.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

## 3. Limitations of just copying from Starboard -- how to fix some of this with Altair

Side by side, from Starboard (no interactivity):

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/sidebyside.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

Including a `brush` selection and a `transform_filter` in our dashboard for interactivity:

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/dashboard_mobility_from_dict.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>


## 4. Making the plot fully in Altair with data stored online)

Making a quick scatter plot:

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/scatters_mobility.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

Remake dashboard, all in Altair:

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/dashboard_all_in_altair.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>



## 5. Making plot fully in Altair with local data

Starting here in Week 12 -- final way of using Altair with fully local data to make the mobility dashboard.

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/dashboard_all_in_altair_subset.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

Note: we made sure that the local dataframe that we passed to Altair was as small as possible (subsetting by columns in our case).
