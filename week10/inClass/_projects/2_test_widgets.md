## Testing to see if this will work...
 
So tried it a few different ways, the short answer is no.  It *might* work if the online-saved HTML from ipyvolume ends up working, but right now that is not working.

Could also figure out how to copy all of the JS paths/scripts correctly, but kind of over it.
