<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide10.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
so, lets say I want to turn in a weekly viz and I google for data viz and find this great example on wikipedia

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide2.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
and I find some phrases I really like and want to include in my assignment

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide9.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
so I just include those phrases just as is in my weekly writup


---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide3.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
ok, so I save this as a docx file and submit this on my homework page

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide4.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
now I see this page and some confettii which is great

but I don't know if this is a problimatic submission, how do I check? ...

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide4.5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
what I can do is click on "submission details" in the upper left corner

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide7.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
you'll then have to agree to the terms of service

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
you'll then see this screen...

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide5.5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
this icon means that your similarity report is being generated

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide6.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
then I see that I've got an 80% similarty which is even highlighted as bad because its red (we'll talk about colormaps more next week!)

what are some of the issues?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide6.5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
if I click on this little tag, it will take me to my similarit report

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide8.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
so here we can see its indeed the phrases I copied -- no big surprize here!  So, how can I fix this?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide8.5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
One tempting solution is just to put quotes around all direct quotes but then leave as is like

I've even included citations and everything!  Let's try again...

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide6.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
so now I'll go back to the main view...

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide6.75.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
and click on "re-submit assignment" to try again

and do all the steps to re-generate and check my report

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide15.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
and I'll do all of that and see that its still pretty high -- 78%

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide14.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
if I click in, I'll still see the same areas highlighted -- why? well even though I cited my sources, the majorty of my submission is actually other people's words, which isn't what we are going for (more on the motivation on that in a minute)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide14.5.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
Let's try again.  So, how I re-explain in my own words what this diagram is and how it was made.  I still use the quote from wikipedia, but I also have an extra sentence describing how that quote relates to *my interpretation* of the figure.

Notice -- the grammar isn't as nice, and the language is much less formal.  This is totally fine!

Let's try resubmitting now.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide16.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
hey look at that!  its much better!

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="turnitin/slide17.png" data-background-size="auto 100%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
now if I click on the similarity score again and see my report we can see that the quotes are still highlighted, but this is fine because the majority of the text is mine

## Motivation

notes:
so, why are we going through this whole process?

## Motivation

https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/

notes:
one motivation is the fact that we sort of have to -- its part of university policy

We are going through this whole FAIR process to avoid having to go through the FAIR violation process

if you do get a FAIR violation I want to highlight the page **go to website** where it says DO NOT PANIC -- please hed this advice!

Educational benefits:
 * practice writing skills
 * paraphrasing helps us [cement understanding](https://www.ascd.org/books/summarization-in-any-subject-60-innovative-tech-infused-strategies-for-deeper-student-learning-2nd-edition?chapter=summarizing-savvy) 

notes:
more important to that is the educational benefits

 * writing is hard, technical writing is harder -- this is an opportunity to practice!
 * paraphrasing, summarizing, and things like this actually helps us understand subjects better -- another opportunity to practice this!
